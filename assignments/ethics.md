# Short Paper #1: Ethics of "Taste, Ties, and Time"

In this week's readings, you read about a controversial research project which collected data from Facebook profiles of all members of the Class of 2009 at a "diverse private college in the Northeastern U.S." As you are now well aware, there has been a significant ethical debate over the propriety of this project and whether researchers should use this dataset.

In a short paper (1000-1200 words), assess this project's adherence to Salganik's four principles of ethical research. As a reminder, the four principles are:

1. Respect for persons
2. Beneficence
3. Justice
4. Respect for law and public interest

In addition, explain whether or not you would use this data for your own research (if made available) and why.

I am not asking you to summarize the project or its related publications. Rather, I'm asking you to engage the material and conduct your own independent analysis. Cite outside papers and articles as necessary. You are of course free to discuss specific components of the data or aspects of the project that you feel are relevant to your arguments, but the paper should not read as an extended summary of the project.

You will probably find it helpful to read some of the original publications based on this dataset, as well as scholarly responses. Here is a selection of relevant papers (this is only a partial list - you may find more if you conduct your own search):
