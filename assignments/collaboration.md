### Kaggle open call projects (3 points)

[Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a data science website that hosts open call projects, datasets, data science competitions, code, and more.

1. Create an account with [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) and sign in.
1. Explore the Kaggle [competitions page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions), which maintains a list of open call projects. Describe one that is of interest to you. What is the goal of the competition? What would you have to do to make a submission?
1. Explore the available datasets on the Kaggle [datasets page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). Download one of the datasets and generate a descriptive plot that highlights some instructive characteristic of the data. Make sure your plot has a title, labeled axes and axis titles, and a legend if necessary. Submit your script (`.R` or `py`) and your plot (saved as a PDF). Make sure your script is properly commented and reproducible.

### Improving a journal article (3 points)

Look through a recent issue of a journal in your field. Find a paper that you think could have been reformualted as a human computation project. How would you formulate the data collection as a human computation project? How might this improve the study?

### Amazon Mechanical Turk (4 points)

Many human computation projects rely on participants from [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome). Sign up to become a worker on Amazon MTurk by clicking the "sign in as a worker" link in the upper-right corner of the home page. Spend one hour working there in some HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks). Show evidence of your hour of work by attaching a screenshot of your "Your Account" page and your "Qualifications" page.
