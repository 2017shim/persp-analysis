### Research Question: Could a digitally-enhanced survey associated with STEM vs. non-STEM news topics reveal the risk for stereotype threat in a digital media domain?

Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as a self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about oneâ€™s social group (Steele & Aronson 1995). Although a wide variety of social groups are susceptible to stereotype threat, as the conditions the produce it are ones in which any highlighted stereotype implicates one though association with a social category, one of the most widely vulnerable and highlighted social groups is that of women in math and STEM careers and majors. Situations that increase the salience of the stereotyped group, in this case, women in math, can increase vulnerability to stereotype threat, as one will be more likely to view oneself in terms of that group membership. For example, statistics about male and female performance in math or the salience of the difficulty of a math evaluation has been shown to undermine performance because of concerns about possibly confirming negative stereotypes.

Research has shown that stereotype threat can cause underachievement on classroom exams, standardized texts, and other tasks in non-academic domains, as well as increased use of self-defeating behaviors, disengagement, and altered professional aspirations. Although these outcomes have shown clear implications for the growing field of stereotype threat research, it is crucial to examine the real-world situations that may bring salience to the social category and stereotyped group.
