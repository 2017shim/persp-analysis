# Clustering states

## Introduction

```{r clustering}

library(tidyverse)
set.seed(1234)

USArrests <- read.csv("USArrests.csv")

```

### 1. Perform PCA on the dataset and plot the observations on the first and second principal components.

### 2. Perform $K$-means clustering with $K=2$. Plot the observations on the first and second principal components and color-code each state based on their cluster membership. Describe your results.

### 3. Perform $K$-means clustering with $K=4$. Plot the observations on the first and second principal components and color-code each state based on their cluster membership. Describe your results.

### 4. Perform $K$-means clustering with $K=3$. Plot the observations on the first and second principal components and color-code each state based on their cluster membership. Describe your results.

### 5. Perform $K$-means clustering with $K=3$ on the first two principal components score vectors, rather than the raw data. Describe your results and compare them to the clustering results with $K=3$ based on the raw data.

### 6. Using hierarchical clustering with complete linkage and Euclidean distance, cluster the states.

### 7. Cut the dendrogram at a height that results in three distinct clusters. Which states belong to which clusters?

### 8. Hierarchically cluster the states using complete linkage and Euclidean distance, after scaling the variables to have standard deviation $1$. What effect does scaling the variables have on the hierarchical clustering obtained?
