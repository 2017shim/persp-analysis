Exploration Write-Up
====================

Introduction
------------

For my exploration write-up, I focus on two different topics based on what I learned from my exploratory data analysis: 1) how does family size, in terms of children and number of siblings, vary with both religious denomination and reported strength; and 2) what subjective confidence in national systems (e.g., business, medicine) varies with reported subjective happiness?
