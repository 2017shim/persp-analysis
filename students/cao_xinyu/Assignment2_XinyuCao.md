# Digital Enhanced Survey on New Job Opening
Author: Xinyu Cao
Assignment 2

## Research Question
In finance and macroeconomics, job opening data is a very important measure for of labor market conditions. Thus, it has significant impact on the economical prosperity and future monetary policy, fiscal policy implication as well as an important parameter for assets pricing purposes. The new job opening data for the labor market is collected by Bureau of Labor Statistics's Job Openings and Labor Turnvoer Survery (JOLTS). However this large survey of job opening data conducted by JOLTS is expensive and might lag behind of time. Using the Linkedln job market network data(such as CV the job position before and afterwards). Blumenstock et. al (2015) described a method of using survey and phone call data to estimate localized and timely information of income distribution. We could apply their method where they used in digital enhanced survey method of the network of income to the network of job market.

## Digital Enhanced Research Design
The main part of this survey enhanced research is to collect job market digital trace data, i.e. what is the job most related other job. We could observe the pattern of how job market is related. So that, we know how those jobs are connected. Using this digital trace data, we could build a digital job market network. In the mean time, we could conduct a small sample survey of the job market to ask them what is their own job opening. Using this feature, we could obtain a large sample by combining a small sample survey with this network way of digital enhanced method.

1 Ask question: 
In order to collect a sample data for prediction, we conduct a survey of small sample that are part of the labor market. The question should be framed as the same of JOLTS as "how many job opening do you have", while in the same time, in order to identify the job, the following information of new job post will be asked:
   1. name: job title, job type, company name
   2. qualification: required educational background, license, or certification requirement, experience requirement
   3. compensation: seniority level, wage range
   4. demographic information: location, sector/industry

2 Digital Trace Data Collection: 
The second step for this research is to collect curriculum viate information of the user in Linkedin. The main information to be collected is the the following: the first parts of this information should be the same of the survey question part. Thus, we are able to matching all those job in the survey with those jobs in the curriculum vitae. Second part, of the information to be collected is the preceding order of the job they had. we could assume that a particular job that is before or after another job is closely related to another in the labor market newtork.

3 Large sample prediction: 
Combining both the small sample survey of the future job opening and the digital trace, we could build a large sample system for the job market in Linkedin. By utilization of this system, we are able to build a job opening statistics based on enhanced survey data.


## Strength and weakness of the method
There are several potentiall problems that might arise from this question. But some of them I already talked about when I was doing my observation data problem. Thus, I will only briefly mentioned them in here and talk something particular important to this research design and tried to compare strength and weakness of both methods.

1 Sensitive: 
  Compared to job posting data on Linkedln, the Curriculum Viate(CV) is more sensitive. However, this pratice generally should be fine. This is because when we collecting the data, we de-personlize those data,i.e. we filter out the personal information such as name, and address so that the data is not sensitive anymore. Beside, Curriculum Viate data on Linkedln is kind of public available information, thus less sensitive. Second, the issue we concerned is about the network structure of the job market. Thus, this data collecting process will focused more colletive pattern rather than particular behavior of particular indiviudal.

2 Sample non-representative and drift:
  As mentioned in last paper, potential problem might arise from the fact the job market website might not able to represent the whole economy and the user base might shift across the time. By applying non parametric categorization strategy in Racine & Li (2004) JOE paper, and matching strategy in Pimentel et.al (2015) JASA paper. We could at least partly address the the problem. 

3 Dirty:
  Survey data and CV data are more standardized, therefore it is much easier to clean compared to counting job posting data by using observation data. However, this method still needs non trivial amount of work on natural language processing. That said, we could still utilization of method of Tang et.al (2017). 

4 Cheaper and more detailed compared to JOLTS survey:
  By using digital enhancement method, we could get a much cheaper, more detailed and more timely data compared to JOLTS survey data. By using a small sample of the survey we could achieve not only a overall job market situation, but also a detailed a district level job market situation. This detailed statistics could not only will have impact on overall monetary and fiscal policy implication, but also could be used as policy evaluation statistics as overall.
  

## Conclusion
This method enables us to estimate the job opening statistics on a cheaper, timely and more detailed method with much lower cost. It can provide deeper insight into district level employment situation, which potentially can provide micro cost-benefit evaluation tools for unemployment micro-intervention policy. In this era of populism, to understand deeper of unemployment of at local level such as district and area rather than the overall statistics might be a better approach for us to tackle the most salient problem in our era. Academia and society might able to benefit from this digital enhanced survey of job opening.
