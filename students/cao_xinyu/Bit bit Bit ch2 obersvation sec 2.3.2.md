# Bad Charaterstics of big dat
## Incomplete
* created other than purpose of research
missing three types of infomation: demographics, behavior on other platforms, and operationalize constructs
eg: Watts(2006): evolution of the social network:
    + email logs do not include data about demographic charateristics - gender and age
    + does not include communication through other media: phone call, text, conversation 
    + no information about relationships
* Construct validity of theoratical concept are hard:
    + *Assess the construct validity* is to take the main claim in the paper: 
      1) in terms of constructs 
      2) re-expres it in terms of data used
    + eg: smart people earn more
      1) people who score well on the Raven Progressive Matrices Test have higher income on their tax returns
      2) people on Twitter who used longer words are more likely to mention luxury brands
    + other examples:
      1) email logs from a univeristy - social relationships
      2) social media posts - civic engagement
      3) email logs from a firm - cultural fit in an organization
* Ways to address the concern of incomplete demographics and behavior on other platforms:
    + actually collect the data you need
    + user-attribute inference
    + imputation - use the information they have on some people to infer attributes of other people
        merging or record linkage

        >> Each person in the world creates a Book of Life. This Book starts with birth and ends with death. 
          Its page are made up of records of the principle events in life. Record linkage is the name given 
          to the process of assembling the pages of this book into a volume.
