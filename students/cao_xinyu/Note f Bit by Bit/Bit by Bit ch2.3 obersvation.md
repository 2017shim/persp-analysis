# Bad Charaterstics of big dat
## 1. Incomplete
* created other than purpose of research
missing three types of infomation: demographics, behavior on other platforms, and operationalize constructs
eg: Watts(2006): evolution of the social network:
    + email logs do not include data about demographic charateristics - gender and age
    + does not include communication through other media: phone call, text, conversation 
    + no information about relationships
* Construct validity of theoratical concept are hard:
    + **Assess the construct validity** is to take the main claim in the paper: 
      1) in terms of constructs 
      2) re-expres it in terms of data used
    + eg: smart people earn more
      1) people who score well on the Raven Progressive Matrices Test have higher income on their tax returns
      2) people on Twitter who used longer words are more likely to mention luxury brands
    + other examples:
      1) email logs from a univeristy - social relationships
      2) social media posts - civic engagement
      3) email logs from a firm - cultural fit in an organization
* Ways to address the concern of incomplete demographics and behavior on other platforms:
    + actually collect the data you need
    + user-attribute inference
    + imputation - use the information they have on some people to infer attributes of other people
        merging or record linkage
        > A metaphor by (Dunn 1946)
        >> Each person in the world creates a Book of Life. This Book starts with birth and ends with death. 
          Its page are made up of records of the principle events in life. Record linkage is the name given 
          to the process of assembling the pages of this book into a volume.
        This book of life could also be database of ruin(ohm 2010) if for te unethical purposes.

## 2. Inaccessible
* Rich government data are inaccessible to researchers
    + Serious legal, techniqcal, business, and ethnical barriers:
      1) terms of service agreements for website for allow data for services imoprovement
      2) business risks to share data
      3) data breach for an existential risk for the company
    + successful partnership:
      1) research interest, capability, company interest and capability
      2) downsie: no bad image results, not able to share data, conflict of interest

## 3. Non-representative
Two sources of non-representativeness are different polutations and different usage patterns
eg: Twitter users are not random sample of Americans, some people contribute more 
Think about the data you don't have!

## 4. Drifting
* Poulatuion drift:
  The people use the system change
* Behavioral drift:
  The behavioral of those people change
* System drift:
  facebook increase the limit on the length of status update
any longitudinal study will be vulnerable to those

## 5. Algorithmically confounded
Behavior in found data is not natural, it might be driven by the engineering goals of the system.
eg: The magic 20 of Facebok encourage people to make friends.
>> A metaphor
> People are in casino

## 6. Dirty
Junk and Spam
Automated Bots in wikipedia

## 7. Senstive
Information that companies and governments have is senstive
* emtional harm - embarrassment
* economic harm - loss of employment
