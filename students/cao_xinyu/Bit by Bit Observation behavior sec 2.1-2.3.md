# BiB by Bit Ch2 Observation Behavior 1-2.3

## 2.1 Introduction 

### Category of Big data:

* Digital traces: 
these data are the by-product of people's every day actions.
The expensive data of human behavior becomes cheap. The digital data are created and stored by a business.
    + click on a website
    + make phone call
    + credit Card Payment

* Government Data: 
about people and business

### Collect your own data using the ideas in Digital Age!

Understanding Observational data:
Any data that comes from observing a social system without intervening.
* without talking with oeople
* without changing people's environments

Three parts:
* Section 2.2. big data and the difference of the big data and traditional data
* Section 2.3. ten common charateristic of big data
* Section 2.4. three main research strategies: counting things, forecasting things, and approximating an experiment

## 2.2 Big Data

* Idealized data is the data collected by scientist to test their ideas. 
* Limited resources to collect large rich and nationally representative data for individual researchers

Traditioanl:
Large-scale social surveys designed, prepared by researchers and for researchers:
* the General Social Survey(GSS)
* the American National Election Study(ANES)
* Panel Study of Income Dynamics(PSID)

Ditigal Age:
Data sources that created and collected by businesses and governments:
* making a profit
* providing a service
* administering a law
eg:
Twitter: 
* For research: studying aspects of public opinion
* For company: make a profit


Categorial of Big Data:
* Government administrative records:
    Used in the past, but now in increasing
    + birth, marriage, and death records
    + digital meters insie every taxi in the city 
       - taxi driver, start time and location, stop time and location
    + eg: Henry Farber(2015) relationship between hourly wages and number of hours worked

* Business administrative records:
    + search engine query logs
    + social media posts
    + call records from mobile phones
    + check-out scanners - real time measures of worker productivity
    + eg: Mas & Moretti(2009) checkout data 
          - worker's productivity is impacted by the productivity of their peers

## 2.3 Common charateristics of big data

### Good 
* Big:
  Many people, Lots of information, Many observations over time
  1) It's useful make estimates for specific subgroups
  eg: King, Pan and Roberts(2013) censorship in China, categories - how and why censors certain types
  2) Study rare events
  eg: Goel et.al (2015) how tweets can go viral
  because large cascades of re-tweets are extremly rare
  3) Detect Small Differences
  differences between 1% to 1.1% click through rates on d can translated into millions of dollar
  4) Causal explaination
  5) Increased concern of systematic errors



* Always-on
  Constantly collecting data, provides researchers with longitudinal data
  1) Study unexpected events
    + Occupy Gezi
    + Umbrella protests
    + Shooting of police in NYC
    + Joining ISIS
    + 911 attck
  eg: Duncan Watts(2015) do more by using the always-on nature of Twitter to study Twitter-using protester before, during and after the event
  2) Produce real time measure
  eg: Castillo (2016) guide responses to natural disasters
  3) Drift in big data systems overtime



* Non-reactive
   + Reactivity:
      this behavior change in response to researcher measurement
   + Does not ensure that data are not a direct reflect of people's behavior
   + algorithmic confounding - impacted by the goals of platform owners
      a public backlash against increased digital surveilance lead to more reative

### Bad
* Incomplete
   created other than purpose of research
   missing three types of infomation: demographics, behavior on other platforms, and operationalize constructs
   eg: Watts(2006): evolution of the social network:
      + email logs do not include data about demographic charateristics - gender and age
      + does not include communication through other media: phone call, text, conversation 
      + no information about relationships
    Construct validity of theoratical concept are hard:
      + *Assess the construct validity* is to take the main claim in the paper 
        + 1) in terms of constructs 
        + 2) re-expres it in terms of data used
          eg: smart people earn more
            1) people who score well on the Raven Progressive Matrices Test have higher income on their tax returns
            2) people on Twitter who used longer words are more likely to mention luxury brands
          other examples:
            1) email logs from a univeristy - social relationships
            2) social media posts - civic engagement
            3) email logs from a firm - cultural fit in an organization
    Ways to address the concern of incomplete demographics and behavior on other platforms:
       1) actually collect the data you need
       2) user-attribute inference
       3) imputation - use the information they have on some people to infer attributes of other people
          merging or record linkage
          > Each person in the world creates a Book of Life. This Book starts with birth and ends with death. 
          > Its page are made up of records of the principle events in life. Record linkage is the name given 
          > to the process of assembling the pages of this book into a volume.
