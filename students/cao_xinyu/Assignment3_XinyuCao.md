# Racial and Gender bias and Job Market Tightness
Author: Xinyu Cao
Assignment 3

## Research Question
In classical Mortensen & Pissarides (1994) paper, the concept of labor market tightness is job seekers find job more quickly and employers take longer to fill jobs. It is not difficult to imagine, at the time when or the place where the economic situation is severe, the racial and gender bias is more likely to outbreak. In Bertrand and Mullainathanâ€™s (2004) paper, they studied the labor market discrimination using resumes of fictional resumes for different jobs. Similar method is used in Doleac & Stein (2013), where they studied the racial bias in online market sale. 

Using their methodology, I propose a longitude study to analyze following questions: 
1. whether racial and gender biases still exist in labor market? \
This is a question which is fundamental to the second one. Since if we want to study whether labor market tightness will affect the racial and gender biases, we must first study the existence of the biases.
2. how those biases are affected by labor market tightness? \
This phenomenon is widely observed by social scientist. For example, Krosch & Amodio (2004) paper documented the effect that the economic resource scarcity causes decision makers to perceive African Americans as "Blacker". 


## Digital Experiment Research Design
In our experiment, we first generate a standardized CV database according to the CV information posted on the LinkedIn for randomly selected job posting in LinkedIn. And based on those standardized database, we generate a sample of fictional CVs. Using those fictional CVs, we change the name information and photo information based on the racial and gender treatments. After those treatment, since other information is random, it is reasonable to assume that the response rate difference of different fictional CV is due to the information treatment of the racial and gender.

1. Randomized CV generalization: \
In our method, we first try to generate a standardized CV database according to the company's typical employee's CV. By saying a standardized CV database, I mean a CV database with a list of typical degree type, a list of typical previous experience, a list of typical language and other skills. Using those standardized CV database, we could randomly generate a sample of CV.

2. Identities Treatment - Rich Experiments:\
After we get a series of randomly generated CVs, we could introduce racial and gender treatment of the fictional CV. Thus, we yield 4 factorial design. First, we could try to use a racial and gender-neutral name. For example, for racial treatment, we could assign, according to the figure the 2016 population statistic by United States Census Bureau, very White sounding name to 61.3% of the CVs and African-American sounding name to 13.3% of the CVs, when we conduct the first experiment at 2017. Motivate by the similar procedure we will also do a gender treatment, and a racial and gender treatment. 

3. A longitude Data Field Experiment Data Collection: \
In order to exploit the second component of study, we tried to collect a longitude data. So that we are able to use the randomization of labor market tightness in different industry to analyze whether those biases are affected by the labor market tightness.


## Assessment of the research design
1. Racial and Gender Bias change overtime - Statistical Validity: \
One of the main concern is the racial and gender bias is changed overtime. For example, gender bias in the United States reduced cross time according to Tang et. al (2017) paper. To single out the time variant effects. We will try to exploit the variation of labor market tightness across industry to estimate how local treatment effects. If change of the bias is not systematic correlated with the labor market tightness, then our method suffices the randomization.

2. Names are related with social background - Internal Validity: \
The second of the concern of source of discrimination of randomly generated name is that it is possible that the employer discriminate against the individual solely by the name hints they comes from a disadvantage social background rather than racial discrimination. For example, if they named a typical black. To take this social background discrimination into account, we could estimate this effects by using the social background and name connection using the method of the paper Fryer and Levitt (2003) paper. In their paper used the birth certificate data for women born in 1973-1974 and for when they give birth themselves in 1989-2000 to estimate the effect of potential Black name might be able to make reference the social background.

3. External Validity: \
Since our research results could answer the question if the labor market tightness will affect the extend racial and gender bias. The answer could potentially generalize to all market behavior, is that in any market, for instance car dealer market, the supply and demand tightness, the ratio of potential second hand car and potential buyer, will affect the consumer choice, i.e. to less trust a Black dealer in situation of less demand of second hand car? This could turn into a further research using the same method thanks to the digital field experiment. 

4. Heterogeneity of treatment effects: \
Heterogeneity is taken care by our experimental design. First, I divided the employer into different industries. Second, as the experiment specifies, I developed full factorial analysis for 4 set of experiment of control group, racial treatment group, gender treatment group, and racial and gender treatment group. Third, since people of different age might also have different extent of gender bias, in my experiment, I will take the HR's demographics as control variables to estimate different treatment effects.

5. Causal mechanism: \
Even though we are possible to observe those gender biases from our experiment. But to draw a causal inference of a racial or gender biases should be more careful. There are several alternative explanations to our explanation of racial or gender bias. Because, although employer response differently to the same set of observable signals. It might because that Black people and women benefits from affirmative action, they get those credential in our randomized generated CVs. Therefore, employer value less of the credential in those CVs.

## Note
1. This assignment is largely based on the framework proposed by Prof. Salganik in his book, Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age. Princeton University Press.
2. Much of the research internal design of how to estimate the racial and gender bias is draw from Michael and Mullainathan (2004), but the method for digital age and the idea of testing the relationship of labor market tightness and the extent of racial gender bias is new.
