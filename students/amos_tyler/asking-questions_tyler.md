 You should (briefly) state your topic of interest and the specific question you seek to answer in this research project. Next, identify the basic structure and format of the survey and the key questions you would include.

The bulk of your proposal should be a critical assessment of why you believe this project will be a good example of digital research. This includes:


# Ecological Momentary Assessment: Longitudinal Tracking of Food Security in Isolated Canadian Regions

## Research Question

This study will investigate weekly, seasonal, and annual trends in food security across isolated Canadian communities. The principal research question will be:
  * How does perceived food insecurity change by month and season in isolated Canadian communities?
With sub research questions:
    * To what extent do traditional food acquisition strategies mitigate food insecurity?
    * Are there intra-seasonal periods of increased food insecurity?
    
For the purposes of this study, Government of Canada standard definitions apply (Government of Canada). Food insecurity  will be understood as a state where households were uncertain of having, or unable to access enough food to meet the needs of all their members because they had insufficient money for food. Food security will be a state where households have access to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members. 

Isolated communities will be identified based on Treasury Board of Canada criteria. The Treasury Board defines isolation in terms of population, climate, and availability of commercial transportation/access by all-weather roads, as well as its position relative to the 60th parallel. (National Joint Council 2017) 

The population of interest in this study will be all people living in isolated communities. The sample population (selection procedures are described in more detail below) will be adults living in isolated communities who own mobile phones. 
    
## Motivation
    
Findings from this study may allow for improvements to government policy on northern food insecurity, specifically in the context of the Nutrition North initiative. (Dietitians of Canada 2016) Nutrition North provides subsidies to improve access to perishable foodstuffs in isolated and remote comunities. With a clearer picture of intra-seasonal or weekly fluctuations in food security, Nutrition North and affiliated programs can more effectively prioritize resources. 

## Digitally Enhanced Survey Design

This survey will leverage the advantages of momentary ecological assessment to deliver numerous, short survey questionnaires to respondents over the course of an entire year. Through mobile phone-based surveys, respondents in isolated communities will respond to designed to identify food insecurity.

While digitally enhanced methods generally focus on areas of high connectivity, this study will pilot how digital enhancement can allow for improved access to areas of low connectivity. Through an application installed on respondents' phones, they will be prompted to answer questions at specified time-based intervals. If the respondent is in a location with mobile connectivity, the answers will be sent via text message to the researcher. In areas with no connectivity, the phone will store the (encrypted) responses for sending when connectivity returns.  

### Respondent Selection

Respondents will be drawn from the population of adult living in isolated communities in Canada.  Following the Treasury Board of Canada's definition, 277 communities in Canada qualify as isolated. (National Joint Council 2017)

Due to small population sizes in the areas being studied, as well as the inherent remoteness of the sample population, a non-random sample will be used. Instead, respondents will be recruited through in-person recruitment events and outreach to local community organizations and government. Upon recruitment, detailed democraphic information will be collected in order to weight final results. 

Respondents will be motivated through a credit applied to their mobile phone bill. In collaboration with mobile phone service providers, the application will not incur additional costs for the user but will be billed to the project. The exact amount of the credit disbursed to respondents may vary depending on the result of funding applications. This reward has been selected over other options (e.g., coupons for groceries) as it is removed from the issue being investigated and therefore less likely to bias results. 

### Questionnaire
The survey questionnaire will use questions from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) (Statistics Canada) to encourage comparisons with other food security monitoring tools. Not all questions will be asked to maintain brevity. Some questions will be adapted to reflect a custom time frame.

#### Question Selection and Timing
Questions FSC_Q010, FSC_Q015, and FSC_Q030 (below) will be asked at pre-determined intervals, or based on previously successful question timing (where success is defined by a completed questionnaire). Questions will be asked at most twice per week to avoid survey fatigue. Moreover, to ensure assessments capture a complete picture of respondents' food security,  one  question will be added, which focuses on traditional food acquisition and use. This question will be asked at the end of each week, based upon the supposition that traditional food acquisition methods are more likely to occur outside the work week, with consumption lasting through to the beginning of the next weekend. This will help to mitigate food security's conceptual bias towards southern, sedentary or urban lifestyles (Power 2008). 

#### Sample Questionnaire:

_Adapted from Canadian Community Health Survey, 2016 updated version_ (in Statistics Canada 2016)

Note: [time period] represents the time elapsed since the most recent response, or one week, whichever is shortest. 

 * FSC_Q10: [You and other household members] worried that food would run out before you got money to buy more. Was this often true, sometimes true, or never true in the past [time period]?
      * Often true
      * Sometimes true
      * Never true
      * Refused (RF)
      * Don't know (DK)
  * FSC_Q015: The food that [you and your household members] bought just didn't last, and there wasn't enough money to get more. Was that often true, sometimes true, or never true in the past [time period]?
      * Often true
      * Sometimes true
      * Never true
      * Refused (RF)
      * Don't know (DK)
  * FSC_Q030: [You or other adults in your household] couldn't feed [the children] a balanced meal, because you couldn't afford it. Was that often true, sometimes true, or never true in the past [time period]?
      * Often true
      * Sometimes true
      * Never true
      * Refused (RF)
      * Don't know (DK)
  * Traditional food sources: In the past [time period], [you or other adults in your household] and [the children] ate mostly food [you or other adults] got from hunting, fishing, trapping, or farming? 
      * Often true
      * Sometimes true
      * Never true
      * Refused (RF)
      * Don't know (DK)

## Added Value Relative to Traditional Surveys and Observational Methods

Relative to observational methods, a survey will allow insight into behaviours which are not normally recorded with digital traces, such as subsistence hunting or fishing. Other variables of interest, such as personal finances and their impact on eating habits, would be difficult to study with observational data. This is primarily due to privacy concerns regarding finances and a lack of readily available digital traces to quantify target individuals' decision making processes. Moreover, cash or barter economies in remote areas do not lend themselves to digital trace observation. Observational approaches to this research question might leverage purchase records at larger grocery stores to extract food prices, however such a research design would not be workable in remote communities that are supplied by sea or air. 

The proposed approach has three principal advantages relative to traditional surveys such as the CCHS. First, by posing a shorter set of questions at frequent intervals, it will be possible to capture fluctuations in food security not only year to year, but between months or even weeks. Second, as questionnaires are shorter, the survey will have a smaller footprint and it is believed it will be less burdensome to the respondent. This is hypothesized to result in higher response rates. Third, the flexible nature of mobile-delivered surveys will allow  data collection in remote and hard-to-reach areas. This is itself a sigificant improvement and will enable monitoring of food security in communities which are inaccessible or difficult to access through the winter months.
