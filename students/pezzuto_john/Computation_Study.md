### Summary of their study

[The article I choose to read](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full) was the class article about a large scale between Cornell and Facebook where they found that that by controlling the "positivity" content of Facebook user's newsfeed they could impact the mood of Facebook users.

The positivity of user's newsfeeds was determined by whether posts had "at least one positive or negative word", which is a very crude way for measuring emotional content. I propose instead that we outsource the determining of positive or negative content to Facebook users via a human computation approach to create a more valid measure of postive and negative Facebook posts.


### How would I formulate the data collection as a human computation project?

Instead Facebook should add a temporary feature that lets users in the control group and experimental groups rate the emotional content of the post simply in the type of emoji responses the post gets. Facebook has "Happy" faces, "Sad" faces, and neutral likes (likes). This is a much more accurate depiction of whether content is positive or negative than looking for single positive or negative words. 

Since most users have hundreds of friends new posts can be classified almost instantly. This would *split* the work among Facebook friends, Facebook could then *apply* these results to the experimental conditions and *combine* posts based on content after they've been rated. People in the experimental condition would get their new posts a moment later than other users but the time difference would be neglibible. There is also a large amount of reliability because it is likely that more than one user will rate posts.


### How might this improve the study?

This would improve the study by being a more accurate measure of whether a post is positive or negative than looking for single words. The study study could then look at the impact of post content more faithfully than just using a broad sweep as it already did. Facebook is naturally an interactive platform, so this would not require much change.
