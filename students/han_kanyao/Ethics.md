## The Ethics of the Montana Election Experiment      


### 1. Assess this study using Salganik's four principles of ethical research.      
#### i. Respect for persons      

There is no doubt that this study lacked the respect for persons. The principle of respect for persons requires that individuals should be treated as autonomous so that researchers should not intervene in their decision without their consent even though interventions may bring harmless or even beneficial results. Obviously, researchers in this study did not try to obtain any stronger or weaker forms of informed consent from their research targets, although they had the awareness that giving more information to voters might change the possibility of their voting. Specifically, the researchers did not clearly informed individuals with their research goals, methods and potential consequences for participants and asked whether they agreed to receive more information about candidates before the beginning of this study. The only non-partisan statement on the mailer was far from enough since the study might have impacts on the outcome of election and even a huge negative impact on Montana government(see beneficence) despite researchers' intention. What's worse, the mailer included a reproduction of the Great Seal of the State of Montana that was very likely to mislead individuals to believe that this mailer was made by Montana government. This was a kind of deception. It  is true that in some circumstances researchers are ethically allowed to do some researches without informed consent or even with deception. For example, researchers are allowed to study discrimination with deception in some situations, to debrief participants after the study is over if the negative impacts would not be too substantial, and to ignore informed consent when participants with consent may increase the risks that they face or it is logistically impractical to get anonymous participants' consent.  Unfortunately, this study was not under any circumstance mentioned above.

#### ii. Beneficence      

Beneficence evaluation is relatively complicated. I will first analyze benefit/risk by dividing them into three parts and then summarize the ethical balance.           
##### Benefit/Risk Analysis          

- For Montana government: Obviously, this study were very likely to bring a negative influence on Montana government since the researchers took advantage of a reproduction of the Great Seal of the State of Montana without authorization. Many voters who complained about the mailers would mistakenly thought the government involved in this study because they didn't know the researchers were not authorized by the government to use the Great Seal. In other words, this study may result in a worse reputation of Montana government that officials there wanted to manipulate election through the mailers. This kind of potential trust crisis for government might result in other political problems.         

- For Election System: This study might have both positive and negative influences on election system at least in a short term. On one hand, providing voters with more public information about who had donate to each of the campaigns could have been a benefit for election system if other ethical principles were satisfied, since more critical information was likely to improve voters' decision-making. However, on the other hand, graphing ideological rankings only based on donating information and without directly indicating ranking standard on mailers can be misleading (most people won't spend their time checking standard on the website printed on mailers). The information on the mailer ignored other information such as candidates' specific decisions and public positions and roughly generated a binary ideological opposition. Given today's polarization of ideology, the study might worsen the polarity and opposition in election. Furthermore, in the long term, this study also might bring both benefit and risk. Politicians may take advantage of the knowledge that providing more ideological information can improve turnout and further manipulate election, but legislative institution can also revise election law based on this kind of knowledge for anti-manipulation.                 

Technically, while it might bring some benefits for election system, this study was likely to have considerable negative impacts on Montana government and election system even if its impacts on individual participants seemed not large. In other words, in this study risks might overwhelm benefits.      

In addition, from the  perspective of ethical balance which assume that some risks render some researches impermissible no matter the benefits, the design of the study was unethically since the risks had been huge enough.      

#### iii. Justice          
Whether this study followed the principle of justice largely depends on its practical impact and the outcome of the election. If this study could better improve the turnout of one group than others and even could change the outcome of the election, this group would reap the benefits and other groups/Montana government would bear the costs. It means the study was very likely to violate the principle of justice. Besides, in order to ensure justice, researchers could also compensate other groups/Montana government if they bear the costs. However, it is impossible for this study because their sample were too large and they won't have the ability to compensate them.

#### iv. Respect for Law and Public Interest      
This study violated the principle of respect for law and public interest. First, its unauthorized use of the Great Seal of the State of Montana might violate the Montana state Law. Second, the proposal of the study was not submitted to University IRB so that it violated university policy in Stan ford. Third, although the researches stated their non-partisan standpoint and intention, I believe they still violated Montana campaign practice laws that require reporting and disclosure of independent expenditures. Because whether they violated the law and ethical principle depended on both intention and consequences. As long as their study might have an impact on election, they had to follow campaign practice laws. Finally, for public interest, if researchers will publish their paper with detailed research goals, methods and results in academic journals, it can ensure transparency-based accountability and thus that the broader public will be informed.              

Generally speaking, this study was unethical.

### 2. Under what conditions might this mailing have altered the outcome of the Supreme Court Justice election?              

Assuming that the support rates between two groups of candidates were very close and the influence of mailers on voters belong to or lean to different ideological standpoints were different, this mailing might alter the outcome. For example, probably in the second race, VanDyke should have got 1000 votes more than Wheat. However, the mailing could improve the voter turnout in terms of 10% for the participants who learn to Wheat but only 5% for the participants who learn to VanDyke. Under this condition, as long as lean-to-Wheat participants were not too less than lean-to-VanDyke, the outcome could be altered by this mailing.

### 3. Non-random experimental sample.      

It has an impact on my assessment of justice and beneficence(risks) in this study. The researchers' behavior might be regarded as manipulating election since they intentionally selected more participants who were likely liberal to centrist. As long as the mailing has a positive impact on turnout, more liberal-leaning candidates and voters can obtain more benefits. Therefore, the fact that some people obtained benefits but others did not have them or even might be harmed violated the principle of justice. Besides, this study also provided an example of manipulating election (no matter what the final outcome was) so that it would have a negative impact on the long-term election system. 

### 4. Non-closeness stated by researchers       

It slightly changes my assessment of beneficence and justice. Since the researchers intentionally select a place where neither race had been closely contested, and thus the study was unlikely to alter the outcome, the risk of bad impact on short-term election system was largely reduced. Besides, the risk that one group may obtain benefit and others (except Montana government) might be harmed due to the outcome alteration was also largely reduced so that justice in this field was better ensured.

### 5. Non-closeness in reality      

According to the outcome, the gaps between two candidates in both races were so vast (170,000 in the first race and 60,000 in the second race) that it was nearly impossible to be altered by around 100,000 experimental participants. Therefore, the risk for beneficence and justice mentioned in question 4 was further reduced. Besides, whether the researchers can debrief the participants after the study rather than obtained informed consent before study was also negotiable since it would not change the outcome. However, other unethical parts would not change.        

### 6. Importance of CrowdPAC

It would further exacerbated the ethical problem in this study. First, Adam Bonica was responsible to let both the participants and the public know that he is the co-founder of CrowdPAC because his identity in this organization means he is a stakeholder. However, his silence about this identity before, during and even after study displayed that he violated both respect for persons and respect for public interest. Second, it also increases the risk of manipulating ideological scores as well as election and thus exacerbating election system because CrowdPAC can easily revise its score criterion and take advantage of the results of this study to support its customers. Finally, since this study would be directly and indirectly taken advantage by CrowdPAC but its benefits for the public were ambiguous, this study also violated the principle of justice. In other words, the public paid for the costs and CrowdPAC and its customers reaped the benefits. 

### 7. What would you do differently?         
I will take four measures to ensure the ethics of this study.          

- **Obtaining a weak form of informed consent:** before formal study, I will a mail or an email, if voters' email addresses are available, a letter to voters. It will tell the voters that 1) we want to conduct a political science experiment and hope to recruit participants; 2) In order to ensure its scientific value, we cannot tell them the details but will inform them after study is over and ensure that our study would not have a negative impact on participants and the society; 3) We are non-partisan; 4) if the voters are willing to participate in this experiment, they can provide their information on our website and then we will send a mailer to them.            
- **Sufficient information on mailers:** On the back of mailers I will print a specific description of how we calculate ideological rankings.         
- **Appropriate sample size and composition:** One of the most efficient methods to reduce risks mentioned in the first question is avoiding too large sample size and disproportionate composition. First, I will only select 2,000 participants rather than 100,000 to make sure that our study would not have a big impact on the outcome of election. Second, the proportions of participants' political standpoint will be based on the party registration information in Montana. If there are too much voters who want to participate, I will use stratified sampling to select participants. It can also largely avoid to violate the principle of justice because voters belong to or learn to different parties have the same probability to be influenced, if there is any slight influence.
- **Asking IRB and Montana officials:** I will also consult IRB and officials in Montana about my study design. For example, I will ask Montana whether I can use the reproduction of the Great Seal and whether we need registration, reporting and disclosure of independent expenditures according to their laws even though this research does not have the intention to influence any race.
