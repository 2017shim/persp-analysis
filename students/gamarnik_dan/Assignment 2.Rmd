# Feeding The Mouth That Bites: Subsidies and Secessionist Demands In Catalonia, A Survey Method

Perspectives on Computational Analysis


### Introduction 

Less attention has been paid to secessionist movements in the civil conflict literature, especially of what causes secessionist demands. This is especially pertinant in the case of Catalonia which had a referendum for independence in 2017. Specifically, I want to ask: do changes in subsidies create secessionist demands?  Within Spanish Catalonia,  I will use an ecological momentary assessment for 700 cell phones (asking about secession) and compare the survey results to text analysis of social media posts.     

### Research Design 

#### Text analysis of social media

As categorized  by [Salganik (2017)](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/observing-behavior/designs/forecasting/), this study would be considered a causal use of big data (as opposed to predictive models) because it seeks to explain why something is occurring and not just predict it. In this case,  the independent variable (sub-national tax funding) does not utilize big data but the *dependent* variable, secessionist demands, does. 

To measure secessionist demands in a non-survey method, I plan on web scraping the users of [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) and and specifically look at thier posts (or in this case tweets and statuses). It will only observe users that are geo-located in Catalonia.   

Like a longitudinal study, this will follow the same users over time. It will measure people over four months and compare their posts to changes in funding of Catalonia. 

Using machine learning techniques, I will then code whether a specific post is pro-independence/secession or not. With machine learning, it will be able to recognize things like ambiguous wording, satire, and bots which can skew normal attempts at coding. Finally, based on this coding, I will test whether pro-secessionist demands have increased among these users in relation to their local funding.This approach has numerous advantages in comparison to other non-big data designs.
