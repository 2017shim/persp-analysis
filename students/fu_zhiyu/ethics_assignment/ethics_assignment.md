# Discussion of the ethics of the Montana election experiment

## Assessment with four principles

### Respect for Persons

Though with some defects, this experiment in general did not violate the principle of Respect for Persons. What this experiment did is just sending mailers to registered voters. No any other intervention is involved. The recipients had full autonomy to decide to whether read it or discard it; they also have full autonomy to vote or not.

Some may argue that registered voters may not be willing to receive such mailers. This is where the subtlety arises from. As mandated by law, the voter records, including the mailing address, should be open data that can be accessed by the public and used for academic purpose. The disclosure of one's registration data is one of the obligations comes along with the right to vote, which voters were aware of when they registered. Hence the registration itself is a a form of informed consent of receiving vote-related mails.

The experiment, however, can still be improved to stick to the principle better. The researchers can add a notification on the envolope or on the header of the mailer, stating that "This mailer contains information pertaining to the Montana Supreme Court Justice election, which, may or may not, affect your voting behavior." Then, recipients are at liberty to discard it after seeing these words if they are not willing to be exposed to more information.


### Beneficence

This experiment did not violate the principle of beneficence. What the researchers did is merely sending out mailers, which can not really harm the recipients (let us leave the harm to the public interest for the next section). 


### Justice

Whether this experiment violated the principle of Justice depends on whether it was nonpartisan as claimed. If not, it would have benefited some certain candidates or parties and hurted others, and hence violated the principle fo Justice. 

Two aspects of the research are vital in order to conform to the principle of Justice: the unbiasness of the information and the unbiasness of the sampling. The information in the mailers are objective scores of the candidates on a political spectrum, calculated from "public information about who had donated to each of the campaigns". Considering it is an objective index, the unbiasness of the information can be guaranteed. We will return to the discussion of the unbiasness of the sampling in the question 3.

### Respect for law and public interest

The main controversial issue of this experiment is that it might have breached the law and harmed the public interest. Legally, there may be some issues like whether this experiment should be treated as an independent expenditure, or whether the use of the Great Seal of the State of Montana permissble in the experiment. However, these are technical problems for lawyers. Let us set aside the legal issue for the moment and stick to the discussion of public interest here. The public interest of a voting is that the results can truly reflect voters' opinions. Indisputably, this experiment must have affected the results of voting to some extent: Some people who may have not voted went to vote after the exposure to new information. The pivotal question is, whether such intervention impede the expression of voters' opinions?

To answer that question, we need to consider two aspects of the experiment. First, whether this experiment is nonpartisan. The discussion for principle of Justice can also be applied here, since the justice of a vote is also the public interest. another aspect is whether the experiment altered the final results of the election. If it did, the experiment is more controversial and sensitive. However, it does not necessarily imply that it is impermissible. If the results were altered because many who would have not voted went to vote, from the perspective of consequentialism, the experiment virtually faciliate the expression of voters' true opinions. Thus, it did not harm the public interest. Nevertheless, this opinion is controversial as some may argue that scientific research should keep neutral and not get involved into politics. Small probability is safer, but it does not immediately justify the experiment. We still need to consider the other aspect, that is, whether it is nonpartisan.

We will discuss this issue more concretely in the answers to question 4 and 5.

## Question 2

Suppose the treatment of mailers has an interaction with the the recipients' political tendencies. For example, Republican leaning voters are more likely to be encouraged by the mailers. Suppose without the experiment, the Democratic party candidates would have win the vote. However, under the treatment of mailers, more Republican leaning voters went to vote, which may reverse the outcome.

## Question 3

Whether this kind of sampling is approporiate depends on the assumption of the treatment effect. If the treatment effect is proportional to the turnout, that is, lower turnout among Democratic voters also means they are less likely to be influenced by the mailers, then the larger sample in Democratic leaning precincts can compenasate such effect so that this experiment will add similar numbers of "new voters" for both parties. If, on the contrary, the treatment effect is homogeneous among voters, then higher sampling weight in Democratic leaning precincts will add more "new voters" for Democratic party, which breachs the principle of Justice as well as the respect for law and public interest. The assumption whether Democratic voters are less likely to be encouraged by the mailers is testable on their data.

My guess is that given the Democratic voters are less willing to vote, it is plausible to assume they are more difficult to be encouraged by mailers. Therefore, it is approporiate to set different sample sizes for different precincts.

## Question 4

Such consideration means the researchers did follow the principle of Respect for law and public benefit. However, there are still chances where the previous Montana judicial elections is not a good predictor for that chosen election. It is still a little risky.


## Question 5

From the outcome, we can confidently argue that the outcome was not altered by the research. The maximum number of the difference of votes the research can possibly affected in theory was close to 64,265 the sample size in Democratic leaning precincts, while the actual gap of votes were 171,559 and 60,399 respectively. Thus, it is impossible for the experiment to alter the outcome.

Given these facts, it is fair to argue that this experiment materially did not violate the principle of respect for law and public interest.


## Question 6

Whether my assessment will be changed depends on the transparency of the "objective scores". If the the algorithm of calculating the objective scores is open-source and reproducible by others, then one of the principal being the co-founder of CrowdPAC is not an issue. However, if the calculation of "objective scores" is not public, then there might be some conflicts of interest. For example, one of the candidates of this election happens to be a client of CrowdPAC, then that principal investigator has the ability to provide biased scores for the experiment for the benefit of the client, which violate the third and fourth principles.


## Question 7

To summarize, according to the information above, this experiment followed four principles well. However, there are still some improvements I would have done if I were the principal investigator. First, as mentioned above, I would add a notification on the header of the mailer informing recipients of the content of this mailer. Second, I would use a smaller sample size. For the purpose of this study, a vaild sample size of 1,000 will be sufficient for statistical methods. A smaller sample size can diminish the intervention to the outcome of the election. Third, I would make sure that the scores we are using in the experiment is open-source and reproducible by other researchers. Otherwise, I may not choose to collaborate with a co-founder of a for-profit comany which provides the scores.
